              <h4>walker's paradise</h4>
              <!-- hiking -->
              <p>
                Ireland has always been a nation of walkers, which means the
                trails are always fresh and clearly waymarked, and yet – apart
                from the most famous spots such as Glendalough or the Giant’s
                Causeway – you’ll have them almost to yourself, as there are so
                many trails to choose from.
              </p>

              <p>
                For walkers, Ireland can’t be beaten. It’s a small island, sure,
                but the variety of landscape is dizzying. Mountains, bogs,
                forests, rivers, beaches and historic towns are all within easy
                reach, which means that the walker can wake up in the morning,
                check the weather and decide over breakfast what sort of walk to
                do.

              <h4>Musical, delicious, active, artistic</h4>
              <!-- festivals -->
              <p>
                Some countries have seasons dedicated to festivals. Ireland has
                an entire calendar. Kicking off in January and packing the
                months until December, festivals in Ireland are in the hundreds,
                and know exactly how to catch our attention.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take the music ones. Some see international bands rocking
                exceptional outdoor venues like Slane Castle. Others host
                traditional musicians in intimate pubs or on remote islands such
                as Valentia and Arranmore. Then you have the foodie festivals.
                One will have you setting out on seafood safaris along the Wild
                Atlantic Way. Another sees casual cooks discuss dishes with
                artisan producers in a medieval city. There's even a little bit
                of everything packed into the likes of Belfast Festival Season
                for good measure.
